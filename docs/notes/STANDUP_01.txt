# STANDUP 01 - 2/9/2023 TEAM BCH


General Update and Intro
========================

Teams assembled and introduced, selected Project Leaders: Iain Winter
Talked to TA
Voted to use Github Issues to keep track of Working Packages/Tasks..
Created Github repo: https://github.com/IainWinter/ChRIS
...

Draft of Requirements
=====================
MAIN: We need to hook into the existing ChRIS code and figure out how they are drawing a DAG of compute nodes.
Then we can start to think of a way to make it better. 

Step 1 this week was getting the dev environment setup, they provided a simple startup script on github so we added some of their
repos and submodules to become familiar with them.

Technologies are already set in stone I think because this has already been worked on, and is currently still under development
from other teams that we arenâ€™t yet in contact with. So, we probably will just be using what they already have, which seems to be mainly 
TypeScript and React.


Current Questions / Problems / Something you need
=================================================
We need to talk to the client to get some more information on what they actually want us to produce, but we have an idea to create
something like a shader graph but for compute nodes.


List of Working Packages with responsible Student and Completion Dates
======================================================================

So far:
   1. Make a Linux VM / partition a host
   2. Install docker and docker-desktop
   3. Clone our repo into ~/dev/

Current:
   4. Run the program locally to gain an understanding of how it works

Next:
   5. By next week we should have changed something about the visualization to confirm that we understand how it works.
   6. Make some sketches and send them to the client to confirm we have an idea of what they want.
